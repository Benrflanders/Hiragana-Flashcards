# HiraganaFlashcardGenerator
Uses Python to generate flashcards of Japanese Hiragana + Romaji.

You can either download and run the code for yourself or download the pdf files and print double-sided. 

To change the font: Download the .ttf file of your font and change the variable "font_file" on line 67 to point to your .ttf file. You must use a Hiragana-compatible font. 

Run the script with the command: ```python hiragana_flashcards.py```
